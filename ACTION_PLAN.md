# Quantum Writer Completion Plan

## Objectives
- Stabilize the developer experience so services and tests run locally without external infrastructure.
- Harden critical context-service functionality to gracefully degrade when vector search infrastructure is unavailable.
- Validate the end-to-end context workflows with automated tests as a baseline for the wider application.
- Stand up a production-ready deployment path for the frontend with Cloudflare Pages and Access single-sign-on.

## Deliverables
1. **Developer Ergonomics** – Ensure the context service package resolves cleanly when the monorepo root contains legacy modules.
2. **Resilient Context Storage** – Provide a fault-tolerant embedding and retrieval pipeline with an in-memory fallback when Qdrant is offline.
3. **Test Coverage** – Run the existing FastAPI integration tests to verify persistence and search behavior using the new fallback path.

## Execution Steps
1. Update the test harness to prioritise the context service package on the Python path to avoid name collisions with the legacy Flask app.
2. Refactor `app.core` to:
   - Lazily initialise the Qdrant client only when available.
   - Add structured logging.
   - Implement an in-memory vector store fallback with deterministic embeddings.
   - Guard store/search lifecycles so database operations succeed even when Qdrant is unreachable.
3. Re-run the FastAPI test suite (`pytest services/context/tests`) to confirm the service operates end-to-end with the new fallback behaviour.
4. Automate the Cloudflare Pages build/deploy cycle and bridge Cloudflare Access identities into the existing auth service for passwordless logins.

## Validation
- Automated: `pytest services/context/tests`
- Manual: Review logs to ensure warnings surface when Qdrant is unavailable (covered implicitly during the automated run).
