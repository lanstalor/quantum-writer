# Quantum Writer Implementation Status

The project now uses a single FastAPI application with async SQLAlchemy and pgvector. Basic JWT auth, story and chapter CRUD, and simple AI streaming are implemented. Vector search works via pgvector. Frontend and additional microservices remain to be integrated.
