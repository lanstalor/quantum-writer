# Quantum Writer Implementation Status Report

## Executive Summary

Quantum Writer has progressed from a bare skeleton to a usable MVP. The project now includes functional microservices for story management, AI generation, and basic context storage. A Next.js frontend ties these services together. While the foundation is in place, several key features like advanced context retrieval and branch merging still need work.

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ What's Working

1. **AI Service**
   - Integration with Groq, OpenAI, and Anthropic models
   - Streaming generation endpoint for Claude
   - Basic prompt handling and token estimation

2. **Story Service**
   - CRUD endpoints for stories, chapters, and branches
   - Chapter generation via the AI service
   - PostgreSQL persistence and async SQLAlchemy

3. **Context Service**
   - Saves and retrieves context per story
   - Naive summarization to respect token limits

4. **Frontend**
   - Next.js 14 editor with chapter reader
   - API calls to story and AI services

5. **Infrastructure**
   - Docker Compose setup with Kong gateway
   - CORS middleware and health checks for all services

### ❌ Remaining Gaps

1. **Advanced Context Management**
   - Vector database integration and semantic search
   - Better summarization and hierarchical context

2. **Branch Handling**
   - Merging branches and version tracking
   - UI for exploring alternative narratives

3. **Analysis Service**
   - Basic character extraction and plot analysis implemented

4. **Authentication & Collaboration**
   - JWT auth only partially implemented
   - No real-time collaboration via WebSockets

5. **Infrastructure**
   - Database migrations, caching, and monitoring not set up

## Next Steps

Focus development on solidifying branch operations and improving context retrieval. Enhancing authentication and adding collaborative editing will follow once the core narrative workflow is stable.
