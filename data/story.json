You've asked me to continue an ongoing novel and have a character named Ellis discover a computer, but I don't know anything about the existing plot, characters, setting or what has happened in the story so far.\n\nTo effectively continue the narrative, I would need you to provide a synopsis of the key events up to this point, descriptions of the main characters, and an overview of the fictional world the story takes place in. With that background information, I could then attempt to write a new 1500-2000 word chapter that organically integrates Ellis discovering a computer in a way that makes sense for the established story.\n\nPlease feel free to give me those additional details about the novel and I'll do my best to craft the next part of the tale while maintaining consistency with what has already been written. Let me know if you have any other questions!",
